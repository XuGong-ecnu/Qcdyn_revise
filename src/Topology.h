/**
 * This class represents the force filed parameters of one system loaded from
 * topology file, such as Gromacs topology file (.top). The definition of a
 * Topology involves four members:
 * 1. The ForceFiled are used to describe the type of force filed used. But, only
 *    AMBER/GAFF force filed is supported now.
 * 2. The AtomTypes stores the name, mass, and van der Waals parameters of atom.
 * 3. The Melecules records the name, type, and number of molecule of this system.
 * 4. The MoleculeTypes stores the atoms (charge), and bonded parameters (such as
 *    bond, angle, dihedral, and so on) of one kind of molecule.
 *
 * Note:
 * 1. this class is designed according to the format of Gromacs topology
 *    file, and the units are that used in Gromacs, i.e., distance in nm, energy in
 *    kj/mol, angle/dihedral in degree, force constant in kj/mol/nm^2 or kj/mol/rad^2.
 *    The unit for angle/dihedral in OpenMM is radian, therefore a conversion from
 *    degree to radian for angle is requested when creating an OpenMM System object.
 * 2. Only only a standalone Gromacs topology file is supported now, which means
 *    the description of "#include" or "#define" can not be processed now.
 *    To create this standalone topology file, ParmEd can be used to convert the
 *    Amber .prmtop and .inpcrd or .rst files into Gromacs .top and .gro files.

     * Internal class of Topology used to describe the type of force filed used. The
     * definition of ForceFiled involves the following members:
     * 1. The name of force filed.
     * 2. The form of the repulsion and dispersion term of van der Walls interaction.
     *    It can be either the (1) Lennard-Jones (or 6-12 interaction) or the (2)
     *    Buckingham (or exp-6 potential) potential. Buckingham is more accurate but
     *    expensive and seldom used.
     *    Only Lennard-Jones potential is supported now.
     * 3. The combination rule to construct the parameter matrix for the nonbonded
     *    Lennard-Jones parameters. It can be (1) used for GROMOS force filed. (2)
     *    Lorentz-Berthelot rule, arithmetic average for sigma, and geometric average
     *    for epsilon, i.e., sigma=(sigma1+siam2)/2, epsilon=sqrt(epsilon1+epsilon2)
     *    which is used for AMBER or CHARMM force filed. (3) geometric average for
     *    both parameter, used for OPLS force filed.
     *    Only Lorentz-Berthelot rule is supported now.
     * 4. Whether or not generating vdW parameters for 1-4 interaction automatically.
     *    For GROMOS force field, should be false, since these paramters have been
     *    defined in its topology file ([ pairtypes ]). For AMBER/CHARMM/OPLS-AA force
     *    field, it should be true.
     *    This parameter is not used now.
     * 5. The Scale factors used for 1-4 Coulomb and Lennard Jones interactions.
     *    For AMBER force field, they should be 0.833333 and 0.5, respectively.
     *    For GROMOS or CHARMM force filed, both of them should be 1.0.
     *    For OPLS-AA force field, both of them should be 0.5.
