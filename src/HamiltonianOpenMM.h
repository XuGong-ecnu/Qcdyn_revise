/**
 * An HamiltonianOpenMM class defines the Hamiltonian of an all-atom system (
 * nuclear information only), which includes smarter pointers to OpenMM core
 * objects (System, Integrator, Context) required by an all-atom simulation.
 *
 * This class is an OpenMM interface based on the modified OpenMM C++ library.
 * The charming feature of QCDyn-OpenMM is that it can do multi-state energy
 * calculation when propagation on one specific state and nonadiabatic dynamics
 * simulation for complex condesed phase system with mixed quantum-classical methods.
 * To realize some special functionalties such as multi-state energy calculation,
 * the modification of OpenMM source code may be required.
 *
 * It can be used to do a classical OpenMM MD simultion with being bound to a
 * DynamicsOpenMM object using the internal Integrator of OpenMM.
 * A general MD simulation requires four OpenMM objects: System, Integrator,
 * Platfrom and Context. System stores the force filed parameters loaded from
 * Topology; Integrator implements an algorithm for advancing the simulation
 * through time; Platform defines an implementation of all the kernels needed
 * to perform some calculation. Context stores the complete state of a simulation:
 * positions and velocities, whose initial values are loaded from Structure object.
 *
 * Moreover, it also can be used to do a nonadiabatic dynamics simulation within
 * diabatic representation with being bound to an object of mixed quantum-classical
 * dynamics object, including surface hopping, mean-field Ehrenfest, and mapping
 * dynamics. In this case, the nulcear propagation is still performed with OpenMM
 * integrator in the OpenMM platform, but the forces used to propagation are
 * provided externally. Therefore, the data (such as positions, velocities, and
 * forces) are stored as OpenMM::Vec3 format and OpenMM real units are used for
 * them. While, within Hamiltonian matrix, the atomic unit (au) is used to keep
 * consistense with model Hamiltonian.
 *
 * Note that all the data that being propagated is stored in the OpenMM internal
 * Platform when running simulation with OpenMM. If you want to get positions,
 * you can call getPostions() to get a copy into data memebr.
