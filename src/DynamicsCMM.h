/**
 * DynamicsCMM class defines nonadiabatic dynamics with phase space classical
 * mapping models (CMMs) developed by Jian Liu [1-2].
 *
 * It includes 5 CMM methods (CMM1, and CMM3-6). All of them use 4 electronic
 * mapping variables, so unlike other mapping dynamics with 2 mapping variables
 * they can not use the general functions for that calculation of effective force
 * and electronic propagation.
 *
 * The five methods (CMM1, and CMM3-6) share same initial sampling method,
 * while the definations of population or coherence operator may different.
 * And 5 functions for electronic propagation are spectially wrriten for them.
 * Although CMM3-6 can use the same algorithm for electronic propagation as CMM1,
 * but the performance is not as good as special one. The effective force is
 * defined from its Hamiltonian just like mean-filed method but with different
 * population or coherence operator.
 *
 * Although, these methods use 4 electronic mapping variables, only 2 variables
 * are indenpendent in initial sampling.
 *
 * And the CMM2 method with 2 mapping variables are defined in DynamicsECMM class.
 * Since the CMM2 method a special case (Î³=0) of eCMM method [3]. And since they
 * are using general two mapping variables, the general function for force and
 * electronic propagation (RK4) can be applied like other mapping dynamcis.
