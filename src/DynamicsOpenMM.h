/**
 * This subclass is used to run a general MD simulation with OpenMM Integrator.
 * We don't define any dynamics method here, just make it became an interface.
 *
 * Note that all the data (positions, velocities, forces) that being propagated
 * is stored in the OpenMM internal Platform when running a general MD simulation
 * with OpenMM.
 *
 * Note that the internal OpenMM::Integrator can only do a general MD simulation
 * since the forces that are used to propagate is only one state.
 *
 * But It can run a special simulation in which the trajectory is propagated on
 * one arbitrary state, the energies of other any states (as long as the topologies
 * are provided) can be computed and reported on the fly, which can replace the
 * energy recalculation based on propagated trajectory in some cases.
