Introduction:
Chemfiles: a library for reading and writing chemistry files
Chemfiles is a high-quality library for reading and writing trajectory files
created by computational chemistry simulations programs. To help you access
information (atomic positions, velocities, names, topology, etc.) about these
files, Chemfiles provides a simple and unified interface to a variety of file
formats.
You can use Chemfiles to conduct post-processing analysis and extract physical
information about the systems you're simulating, to convert files from one format
to another, to write trajectories with your own simulation software, and anything
that requires reading or writing the file formats used in computational chemistry.

Building from Source:
cd chemfiles
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/
make install -j 8

Information:
Current version: 0.10.2 released on Dec. 1, 2021.
Complied by zhubin with GCC 7.3.0 on NYUSH-HPC argonlogin node on Dec. 13, 2021

Modification by zhubin:
The header files of XDR library were added into the "chemfiles.hpp" so that
one can still directly use the original public functions in the XDR library.
